## Submission

Ensure that you are up to date with the upstream Github repo. Do the following before starting your assignment.

```
cd <to your DS219 github repo path>
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git checkout -b assignment7 upstream/main
```

Head to the directory **assignments/assignment7** and create a directory there with your name in the format **FIRST-LAST**.
The directory should be **assignments/assignment7/[FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME]** so you can add the following here:
 
* Add a terminal screenshot of the server hosted on your machine. (Make sure your username is clearly visible on the screenshot for full credit)
* Add a streamlit UI screenshot with an audio transcription.
* Add notes and challenges your faced along the way and also add any improvements and suggestions to the process.

Once done, create a PR to submit.

## Demo

In the final lecture on December 4th, you demo this to the class with your own audio and streamlit UI.

##### Note:

You don't have to change any code just run all the steps and execute the code just with your own audio.
